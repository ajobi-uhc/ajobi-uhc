HI! I'm Arya Jakkli - (Currently Blockchain dev @ Arrivant).

I'm currently in love with everything that is blockchain: MEV, Blockchain data analytics, NFT markets, decentralized storage solutions using Merkle trees and much more!

Specialize in fullstack work - experienced in rust, nodeJS and react when needed. Enjoy doing things from the ground up.
