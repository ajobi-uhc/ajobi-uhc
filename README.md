HI! I'm Arya Jakkli.

I'm currently in love with everything that is blockchain: MEV, Blockchain data analytics, NFT markets, decentralized storage solutions using Merkle trees and much more!

I am experienced in C++, through learning in college and I am self-taught in React, Node.js javascript working with noSQL databases and the whole MERN stack. 
I have also worked with ethersjs and web3js as well as some solidity. I learned all these through learning and participating in many DeFi hackathons
and have helped build VoTARO (https://github.com/zenbitMX/VoTARO/tree/main/frontend/src) a decentralized voting system and ScholarDAO a blockchain based peer-review system that won the HackFS finalists prize. I am now working as a solana blockchain developer at Arrivant

I also have experience working in KraftPowercon as an intern creating sales and software tools to log orders and have build a full stack tool for the company.
